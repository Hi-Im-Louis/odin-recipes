    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the dough, pour water into a container, add salt and sugar. Stir
        until they are dissolved and pour more than half of the flour. Put some
        yeast in one hand and some flour in the other.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crumble the yeast in your hand and slowly pour it in the container while
        you are stirring with the other hand to make sure the flour absorbs all
        the water.
      </li>
      <li>Add more flour and keep kneading.</li>
      <li>Pour the oil and keep kneading until it is absorbed.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough in a flat surface and knead with two hand for about
        20-25 minutes. Make a ball out of the dough and cover it. Leave it to
        rest for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead it again for a couple of minutes and leave it to rest again for
        about 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the dough in half. Take one half and divide it further to make a
        little ball. The weight sould be approximately of about 250-260g.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take all the balls of dough, cover them and leave them to rest at
        18-24Â°C for 8-12 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the tomatoes in a bowl and crush them with one hand, pour some salt
        and olive oil. Add some broken basil leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take the fiordilatte and cut it in half, cut it further to make little,
        long slices.
      </li>
      <li>Start heating the oven 30-40 minutes in advance.</li>
      <li>
        Press the dough from top to bottom to flatten it, do it three times.
      </li>
      <li>Turn it upside down and do the same thing.</li>
      <li>
        Flatten the dough and when it's flat pour some tomato sauce on top with
        a spiraling motion starting from the center. Do not cover the edges.
      </li>
      <li>Add fiordilatte, but not too much. Add a few basil leaves.</li>
      <li>
        Put it carefully in the pizza peel and put it in the oven for 5-7
