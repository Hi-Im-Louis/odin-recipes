    <h2>Brief origin story of olive ascolane</h2>
    <p>
      Olive ascolane are an italian appetizer. They were first created in Ascoli
      Piceno, a city in the region of Marche, from where they derive their name.
      <br />
      They were created by private chefs to use leftover meat after
      celebrations.

        Pour some oil into a pot. Cut a carrot and some celery into pieces and
        put them into the pot together with half an onion. Leave the vegetables
        to cook for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the beef and pork meat you previously cut into the pot and cook it
        for about 20 minutes. After that put the chicken meat too. Leave it to
        cook for about an hour with the lid on. After that turn off the heat and
        leave it to cool off.
      </li>
      <li>Run all the meat through the meat grinder.</li>
      <li>
        Put all the meat in a bowl a pour the cheese and an egg in and knead
        with your hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the olives open on just one side so you can roll them open and put
        the meat you kneaded before and close them to give them the original
        form back.
      </li>
      <li>Pour two eggs in another bowl and mix them with salt.</li>
      <li>
        Pass the olives into the flour and into the egg mixture immediately
        after. Pass the olives in the breadcrumbs to complete the breading.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put all the olives in a tray, heat the olive oil up to 180Â°C and then
        carefully pour the olives in and cook them for about 2 minutes. Pour
        them in another bowl or tray with some kitchen paper to absorb the
        excess oil and serve them.
